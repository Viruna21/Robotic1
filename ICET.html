        <h3>Home page : Introduction to Robotics & Its Applications</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Robotics is a branch of engineering and computer science that involves the conception, design, manufacture and operation of robots. The objective of the robotics field is to create intelligent machines that can assist humans in a variety of ways.Robotics can take on a number of forms. A robot might resemble a human or be in the form of a robotic application, such as robotic process automation, which simulates how humans engage with software to perform repetitive, rules-based tasks.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">However, in the 1940s, the Oxford English Dictionary credited science fiction author Isaac Asimov for being the first person to use the term. In Asimov's story, he suggested three principles to guide the behavior of autonomous robots and smart machines . His three laws of robotics have survived to the present day. However, it wasn't until a couple of decades later, in 1961, that the first programmable robot -- called Unimate, derived from universal automation -- was created based on designs from the '50s to move scalding metal pieces from a die-cast machine. The Stanford Research Institute's robot dubbed Shakey followed suit in 1966 as the first mobile robot, thanks to software and hardware that enabled it to sense and grasp the environment, though in a limited capacity.

            <h3>Robot in Industry  : Kye Advancements in Industrial Automations</h3>
            <p>Robots have become a cornerstone of industrial automation, driving significant advancements in efficiency, precision, and safety. Key developments include collaborative robots (cobots) that work alongside humans, enhancing productivity while reducing risks in tasks that require human dexterity and machine consistency. These cobots are equipped with advanced sensors and AI-driven systems, making them adaptable to changing environments.Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are another breakthrough, excelling in warehouse and logistics sectors. These robots can navigate complex spaces, optimize routes, and manage inventory autonomously, improving operational flow and reducing human error.

AI and machine learning integration in robotics have also revolutionized predictive maintenance. Robots equipped with these technologies can detect early signs of wear or failure in equipment, enabling preemptive repairs and minimizing costly downtime.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, robotic process automation (RPA) has streamlined repetitive tasks, such as assembly line work and quality inspections. Vision systems combined with robotics allow for precision tasks like welding, painting, and material handling, with greater speed and consistency than human labor alone.These advancements are reshaping industries by enhancing productivity, reducing costs, and improving safety, positioning robots as vital components in the future of industrial automation.</p>
